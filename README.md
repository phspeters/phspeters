## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a medical doctor and software engineering student, currently studying at [42 São Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/). My mission is to bridge the gap between healthcare and technology, creating innovative solutions that can improve people's lives worldwide. I'm also deeply fascinated by blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize both healthcare and finance.

### 💡 What Drives Me

Working in healthcare opened my eyes to countless systemic challenges that technology could solve. From convoluted medical records to fragmented patient care, I witnessed firsthand how technical limitations impact patient outcomes. This realization sparked my journey into software development – combining my medical knowledge with programming to build bridges between these two worlds. While I'm still early in my developer journey, each line of code brings me closer to creating solutions that could make healthcare more efficient, accessible, and human-centered.
